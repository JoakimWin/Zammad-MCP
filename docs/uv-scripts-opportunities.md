# UV Single-File Scripts Opportunities for Zammad MCP

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes opportunities to enhance the Zammad MCP project workflows using UV single-file scripts. UV scripts offer self-contained, dependency-managed Python scripts that can replace complex bash scripts, provide better cross-platform compatibility, and improve developer experience through type hints, better error handling, and rich CLI interfaces.

## Current Workflow Analysis

### Existing Scripts

The project currently uses bash scripts for:

- **Setup** (`setup.sh`, `setup.ps1`) - Environment initialization
- **Quality Checks** (`quality-check.sh`) - Running linters, formatters, and tests
- **Bootstrap** (`bootstrap.sh`) - Installing development tools

### Pain Points Identified

1. **Platform Dependency**: Separate scripts needed for Windows (`.ps1`) and Unix (`.sh`)
2. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling in bash scripts
3. **No Type Safety**: Bash scripts lack type checking and IDE support
4. **Complex Operations**: Some tasks (like version bumping, changelog management) are difficult in bash
5. **Dependency Management**: External tools must be installed separately
6. **Limited Interactivity**: Bash scripts offer basic user interaction

## Opportunities Identified

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Scripts (Week 1-2)

1. Start with `validate-env.py` as proof of concept
2. Implement `coverage-report.py` for immediate value
3. Gather feedback from contributors

### Phase 2: Core Development Tools (Week 3-4)

1. Implement `dev-setup.py` to improve onboarding
2. Create `security-scan.py` to consolidate security checks
3. Develop `test-zammad.py` for API testing

### Phase 3: Advanced Tools (Week 5-6)

1. Build `release.py` for release automation
2. Add `profile-zammad.py` for performance testing
3. Create `issue-helper.py` for better issue management

### Phase 4: Deprecation (Week 7-8)

1. Update documentation to prefer UV scripts
2. Add deprecation notices to bash scripts
3. Provide migration guide for users

### Backward Compatibility

- Keep existing bash scripts during transition
- Add UV script equivalents alongside
- Provide clear documentation on both approaches
- Remove bash scripts only after full adoption

## Best Practices for UV Scripts

### Script Organization

```text
scripts/
├── uv/                    # UV single-file scripts
│   ├── release.py
│   ├── test-zammad.py
│   ├── coverage-report.py
│   └── ...
├── setup.sh              # Keep during transition
└── quality-check.sh      # Keep during transition
```

### Script Standards

1. **Shebang**: Use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` for executable scripts
2. **Metadata**: Always include inline script metadata
3. **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all functions
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with helpful messages
5. **Progress Indication**: Use Rich for progress bars and status updates
6. **Exit Codes**: Return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration

### Documentation Requirements

Each UV script should include:

1. Module docstring explaining purpose
2. Usage examples in docstring
3. `--help` command with detailed options
4. README section in main project docs

## Conclusion

UV single-file scripts offer significant improvements over the current bash script approach. They provide better developer experience, improved maintainability, and enhanced functionality while maintaining the simplicity of single-file tools. The proposed scripts address current pain points and add new capabilities that would be difficult to implement in bash.

The gradual migration strategy ensures minimal disruption while allowing the team to realize benefits incrementally. Starting with high-value scripts like environment validation and coverage reporting will demonstrate immediate value and build confidence in the approach.
